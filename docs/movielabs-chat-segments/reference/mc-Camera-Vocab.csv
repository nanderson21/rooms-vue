"","ISO","Camera","published","","The rating of the sensitivity of film or a camera sensor to light.","","The higher the ISO value, the more sensitive the film or camera imager is to light. Digital cinema cameras are often rated at 800."
"","Shutter Angle","Camera","published","","A measure of the exposure time of an image relative to the frame rate. 0 < shutter angle <= 360.","","Film cinema cameras use a rotating mechanical shutter that is a disc with a sector cut out and rotated one turn per frame. When the cut out passes over the film, the film is exposed to light. The most common shutter angle is 180 degrees which exposes the film for 50% of the time. If the frame rate is 24 fps, a 180-degree shutter angle would mean the exposure is 1/48th sec. This measurement is used with digital cameras although, with one exception, digital cameras have electronic shutters."
"","EI","Camera","published","","Exposure Index","","Where ISO is the rating of the film or sensor, EI is the rating at which the exposure was made.  For example, if we have a camera rated at 800 ISO and we are shooting in subdued light, we might choose to expose the image as though the imager was 1250 ISO. The EI is then used when the image is “developed” to correct for the difference."
