# MovieLabs Visual Language Room-Based Task Management System

## System Architecture Overview

This system implements a **Room-centric approach** using MovieLabs Visual Language principles to create collaborative workspaces where participants, tasks, contexts, and infrastructure are logically grouped and managed.

## Core Components

### 1. Rooms (Primary Grouping Container)

**Definition**: Collaborative workspaces that serve as the primary organizational unit for production activities.

**Key Properties**:

- **Participants**: Role-based groups (not individual users) assigned to the room
- **Contexts**: Linked assets and content contexts that define scope
- **Tasks**: Work items that inherit participant access from the room
- **Infrastructure**: Computing and storage resources available to the room

### 2. Participants (Role-Based Groups)

Using MovieLabs participant vocabulary, rooms contain **role-based groups** rather than individual users:

**Primary Role Categories**:

- **Creative Roles**: Director, Producer, Art Director, VFX Supervisor
- **Technical Roles**: Editor, Colorist, Sound Designer, Data Manager
- **Production Roles**: Production Manager, Assistant Director, Script Supervisor
- **Post-Production Roles**: Post Supervisor, Online Editor, Audio Mixer

**Implementation**:

- LDAP Groups mapped to MovieLabs participant roles
- Inheritance: Tasks automatically inherit participant access from their parent Room
- Dynamic Assignment: Groups activated when Tasks are "checked out" or "focused on"

### 3. Tasks (Work Units)

**Definition**: Pieces of work completed as production process steps.

**Key Features**:

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Tasks can contain subtasks
- **Participant Inheritance**: Automatically inherit room participants
- **Context Linking**: Connected to relevant assets and creative contexts
- **State Management**: Check-out/focus workflow for active work
- **Version Control**: Capture workspace snapshots and diffs

**Task Categories from MovieLabs Vocabulary**:

- **Conform Finish**: Assemble final imagery with captured material and VFX
- **Color Correction**: Adjust color characteristics of image content
- **Audio Mixing**: Combine and adjust audio elements
- **Visual Effects**: Create or modify imagery using digital techniques

### 4. Contexts (Scope Definers)

**Definition**: Information that defines scope within the creative work construction process.

**Context Types**:

- **Creative Contexts**: Scene, Shot, Sequence definitions
- **Asset Templates**: Rules and qualifiers for file types
- **Infrastructure Links**: Connections to storage, compute, and network resources
- **Folder Hierarchies**: Organized content structures

**Context Properties**:

- **Qualifiers**: Rules for content validation and processing
- **Labels**: Automatic tagging based on qualifier evaluation
- **Asset Relationships**: Links to templates and file type definitions
- **Infrastructure Mapping**: Connections to storage systems and compute resources

### 5. Infrastructure (Resource Layer)

**Definition**: Underlying systems and frameworks required for production.

**Infrastructure Categories**:

- **Storage Systems**: Working Storage, Long-Term Storage, Capture Storage
- **Compute Resources**: Workstations, Cloud Computing, Render Farms
- **Network Infrastructure**: Private Networks, Public Networks, CDNs
- **Production Equipment**: Cameras, Audio Equipment, Specialized Tools

## Access Control & Security Model

### LDAP Integration

- **Group-Based Access**: Participants defined as LDAP groups mapped to MovieLabs roles
- **Task Activation**: LDAP groups assigned when tasks are checked out or focused
- **Layered Security**: Content browsing vs. file access differentiation

### Access Layers

1. **Content/Knowledge Layer**: Browsing access to metadata and structure
1. **File Access Layer**: Actual file manipulation regulated through task checkout
1. **Infrastructure Layer**: Resource access controlled by room and task context

## User Interface Navigation

### Application Integration

- **Creative Application Linking**: Connect tools (editing, compositing, etc.) to tasks
- **Workspace Configuration**: Capture and restore tool states
- **Hierarchical Navigation**: Use task/subtask structure as content navigator

### Workspace Management

- **Snapshot Capture**: Record current workspace state when checking in/out
- **Diff Generation**: Compare workspace states between sessions
- **Version Stacking**: Maintain version history of content and configurations
- **Format Externalization**: Export representations for interoperability

## Implementation Workflow

### Room Setup Process

1. **Create Room**: Define scope and purpose
1. **Assign Participants**: Add role-based LDAP groups
1. **Define Contexts**: Link asset templates and infrastructure
1. **Create Tasks**: Establish work hierarchy with inherited permissions

### Task Execution Process

1. **Task Checkout**: User focuses on specific task
1. **LDAP Activation**: Relevant groups assigned for resource access
1. **Workspace Configuration**: Load associated tool configurations
1. **Content Access**: Files become available through security layer
1. **Work Execution**: User performs task using connected applications
1. **Snapshot Creation**: Capture workspace state and content changes
1. **Check-in Process**: Save work, update versions, release resources

### Context Linking Process

1. **Asset Template Definition**: Create rules for file types and processing
1. **Qualifier Setup**: Define validation and labeling rules
1. **Infrastructure Mapping**: Link to storage systems and compute resources
1. **Hierarchy Creation**: Establish folder structures and relationships

This document is an excellent synthesis of the MovieLabs Visual Language applied to a Room-based task management system. It successfully weaves together industry-standard vocabulary, hierarchical access control, and creative-centric interoperability into a cohesive architecture. Here's how we can enhance and refine it further based on your instructions—for clarity, engagement, nuance, and perfect punctuation.

🧲 **Suggested Engaging Opener (For Executive or Developer-Facing Documentation)**
What if your team's creative applications could organize themselves—adapting tools, access, and infrastructure the moment someone starts working?
With MovieLabs-inspired Room-based task management, collaboration becomes structured, secure, and intuitive—because the workflow aligns with how creators actually work.

🧠 **Deeper Insight: A Nuanced Perspective on the Architecture**
While the system provides strong technical grounding, consider surfacing a few philosophical drivers and practical implications that differentiate this approach:

**1. Agentic Navigation vs. Static Interfaces**
Traditional production interfaces force users into static file browsers and permission trees. Here, Rooms act as intelligent surfaces—contextual environments that respond dynamically based on the user's current task and role. The interface becomes an expression of intent, not just a structure.

**2. Access is Ephemeral, Not Permanent**
By deferring access control to task check-out moments, you move from persistent privilege assignment to ephemeral, need-based authorization. This aligns beautifully with zero-trust principles and can be used to shape audit logs as narrative timelines of action.

**3. Knowledge Layer as a Decoupled Surface**
Separating content browsing (the knowledge layer) from file access means users can see and interact with metadata, preview proxies, read notes, and understand the scope of work—without having full access. This is an editorial-first security model, enabling broader collaboration without compromising IP.

**4. Context as Code**
Treating Contexts as modular, linkable, and composable entities makes them programmable. They become a form of "infrastructure-as-metadata", allowing automation engines (like n8n or internal agents) to reason about assets, storage, and processing pipelines with semantic granularity.

✍️ **Refinement Suggestions (Clarity + Precision)**
Here are specific revision notes for clarity and impact:

"Tasks inherit participant access from the room" →
Tasks dynamically inherit role-based permissions from their parent Room, enabling consistent access without redundant configuration.

"Connected to relevant assets and creative contexts" →
Linked to scoped assets, metadata templates, and infrastructure resources relevant to their creative function.

"Files become available through security layer" →
File-level access is gated by the task's contextual permissions, dynamically activated during task engagement.

"Snapshot Creation: Capture workspace state and content changes" →
Upon task check-in, the system captures a snapshot of the workspace state—including tool configurations, content diffs, and timeline markers—for version tracking and auditability.

"Supports multiple representation formats" →
Supports export of interoperable representations (e.g., XML, JSON, EDL, AAF, DRP), enabling seamless integration with downstream tools and delivery platforms.

✅ **Punctuation Check: A Sample Section**
Original:
Each user is able to link their creative application and content inside to their Tasks and subtasks and then use that hierarchy as a navigator.

Refined:
Each user can link their creative applications and in-app content to Tasks and Subtasks—then navigate intuitively through this hierarchy, using it as both a creative and operational map.

Original:
Workspace Configuration: Load associated tool configurations

Refined:
Workspace Configuration: Load and restore application states, tool preferences, and UI layouts specific to the selected task.

🎯 **Final Suggestions for Implementation**
Include a diagram using MovieLabs icons to visually depict:
- Room → Tasks → Contexts → Infrastructure
- Access flows (e.g., Browsing Layer vs. File Layer)
- Temporal progression (Snapshot → Version Stack → Externalized Format)

JSON schema example for:
- Room definition
- Context object with qualifiers and labels
- Task object with snapshot diff references

Example UI scenario:
- Show a user in DaVinci Resolve checking out a "Color Correction" Task → UI updates → LDAP activated → proxies pulled → snapshot logged → contextual folder mounted
